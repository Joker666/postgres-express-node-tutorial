There's a few things we were hoping to see more of, and if you're interested we'd love to see you accomplish.

First, we'd like to see you complete more of the routes required to make a group todo app. Things like creating tasks, marking them complete, commenting, and all the other things a traditional group todo app like asana, or jira, or trello have. If you could extend your video to show us more of that, it would help us understand a bit more about how you go about building.

Second, we'd love to see how you think about designing systems and how you communicate that in a written format. 
At Chiffer, because we work asynchronously, we really value clear communication through writing. We write, and comment on, a lot of Technical Design Docs to make major design decisions in lieu of meetings, and so it's extra critical everyone on the team be able to communicate their ideas and thoughts clearly. 
 As a next step, let's pretend that you are working on a team that's building a group task management app like Asana, Jira, or Trello (just like with the video interview before this). Please put together an technical design doc (we use Notion on the team, but you can use whatever you want) that explains the decisions you've made so far, and other design decisions you think the team should make as we go about building the app. Feel free to use text, images, video, audio - whatever helps you communicate best. 

Some things to consider: 
- What should be the data model of the application? 
- What should the final database design look like? 
- What are the APIs we'll need to build?
- What are the main chunks the project should be split into? 
- What are the next most important tasks to work on?

This is both part 1a and part 2 of the four part interview process I laid out in my first email :)

Let me know what you think, and looking forward to seeing more of your work!
